    "        - Non-response bias, e.g., opinion polls conducted by mail or online\n",
    "    - When samples not random and independent, we can still do things like computer means and standard deviations, but **we shouldn't draw conclusions from them** using things like the empirical rule and central limit theorem.\n",
